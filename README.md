# How to use Synth

Synth was built with ease of use in mind. Here you'll find a full list of all the quirks and features Synth has to offer.

While Synth may look finished, *we still have plenty of ideas, plans, and upcoming features for Synth* so please stay tuned for those!

## Documentation

This list is ordered by command category/group. If you're looking for a command that you don't know the name of then think of what group it might be in first. Then search down the list for it.

### General

* `help` - Displays all the available commands that come with Synth. Currently anyone can call any command listed in `help`; even commands that change the bot's settings. We're currently in the process of changing that.

Additionally, you can get more information about a specific command if you specify a command as an argument for help.

* `ping` - This just pings the bot. The bot responds with the latency of the ping. That's all it does. You can use it if the bot is being unresponsive to check if the bot is online. If the bot doesn't respond, then it's offline.

* `lobby` - *This is still under development. The command currently has no functionality* 

### Settings

* `color` - Every message the bot sends has a color on the embed. This command allows you to see what color the embeded messages are currently and allows you to change it. Colors must be in hexadecimal format (with the #) or else the color will be changed to black.

### Debug
**These are for dev debugging. If you see these in !help then please let us know**

* `reload` - Reloads command modules. That's all.
